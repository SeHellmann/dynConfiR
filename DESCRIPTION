Description: 
       Provides density functions for the joint distribution of choice, 
       response time and confidence for discrete confidence judgements
       as well as functions for parameter fitting, prediction and simulation 
       for various dynamical models of decision confidence. 
       Implemented models are the dynWEV model (Hellmann & Rausch),
       the 2DSD model (Pleskac & Busemeyer, 2010, 
       <https://doi.org/10.1037/a0019737>), and various Race Models. 
       Cpp-Code for dynWEV and 2DSD is based on the rtdists package by 
       Henrik Singmann.

\usage{
LogLikWEV(data, paramDf, model = "dynWEV", simult_conf = FALSE,
  precision = 1e-05, stop_on_error = TRUE, data_names = list(), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a dataframe where each row is one trial. Containing following variables:
\itemize{
  \item condition    (not necessary; convertable to integer (e.g. factor); for different levels of stimulus quality),
  \item rating            (convertable to integer (e.g. factor); discrete confidence judgments),
  \item rt                    (numeric; giving reaction times for decision task),
  \item stimulus     (values at least convertible to c(-1,1); stimulus category (direction of evidence accumulation))
  \item response     (characters in "upper", "lower" (or convertible to); direction of decision; correct answers are "lower" for stimulus=-1; and "upper" for stimulus=1),

}}

\item{paramDf}{list or dataframe with one row. Names should match the names of dWEV and 2DSD model specific parameter names.
For different stimulus quality/mean drift rates, names should be v1, v2, v3,.... Different sv parameters are possible with sv1, sv2, sv3...
with equally many steps as for drift rates. Additionally, the confidence thresholds should be given by names with
thetaUpper1, thetaUpper2,..., thetaLower1,... or, for symmetric thresholds only by theta1, theta2,.... (see Details for the correspondance to the data)}

\item{model}{character scalar. One of "dynWEV" or "2DSD" for the model to fit.}

\item{simult_conf}{logical. Whether in the experiment confidence was reported simultaneously
with the decision, as then decision and confidence judgment are assumed to have happened
subsequent before response and computations are different, when there is an observable
interjudgment time (then simult_conf should be FALSE).}

\item{precision}{numerical scalar. Precision of calculation for integration over z and t0.}

\item{stop_on_error}{logical. If TRUE an error in the function will be returned in case of invalid parameters. Otherwise, the output will be 0 without error.}

\item{data_names}{list. Possibility of giving alternative column names for the variables in the data. By default columnnames are identical to the
ones given in the data argument description.}

\item{...}{Possibility of giving alternative variable names (unquoted) in data frame (in the form \code{condition = SOA}).}
}
\value{
Numeric scalar. The summed Log-likelihood of the data given the parameters in the respective model. If one or more row-wise probabilities is <=0,
the function returns -1e+12.
}
\description{
Computes the Log-likelihood for given data and parameters in the versions of the dWEV model (Hellmann & Rausch) and the 2DSD model (Pleskac & Busemeyer, 2010).
It is a wrapped version of the respective densities \code{\link{dWEV}} and \code{\link{d2DSD}}, where one can find more information about the parameters (\code{z} is always given relatively, in the likelihood).
The function is mainly used in \code{\link{fitRTConf}} but exported for individual usage in other contexts.
}
\details{
Note, that the requirements on the format of the columns for the likelihood functions are much stricter, than in \code{\link{fitRTConf}}.
This is because the function is very frequently calls in the optimisation routines of the fitting process and the preprocessing steps are
therefore included in that function.

 \strong{rating, condition}. If integer, values should range from 1 to number of possible ratings/conditions. If factor, the number of levels should be
 equal to number of possible ratings/conditions. This should be consistent with the parameter vector. The confidence thresholds should be named
 as thetaUpper1, thetaLower1,.... (or theta1,... for symmetric thresholds), with the number of ratings -1 and the mean drift rates (and possibly the
 standard deviation in drift rates) should be denoted as v1, v2,... (and sv1, sv2,...) with the number equal to the number of conditions. If only
 one condition is used \code{v} will be accepted as well as \code{v1}.

 \strong{stimulus, response}. stimulus should always be given in numerical format with values -1 and 1.
 reponse should always be given as a character vector with "lower" and "upper" as values.
 This corresponds to the situation of Ratcliff's diffusion model (Ratcliff, 1978), where stimulus is the sign of the mean drift direction and
 the response is the "upper" or "lower" boundary that is first hit by the evidence accumulation. A correct decision is therefore "lower",
 if stimulus is -1, and "upper", if stimulus is 1.

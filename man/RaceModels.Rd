}
\value{
\code{dIRM} and \code{dPCRM} return the numerical value of the probability density in a numerical vector of the same
length as \code{rt}.

\code{rIRM} and \code{dPCRM} return a \code{data.frame} with four columns and \code{n} rows. Column names are \code{rt} (response
time), \code{response} (1 or 2, indicating which accumulator hit its boundary first),
\code{xl} (the final state of the loosing accumulator), and \code{conf} (the
value of the confidence measure; not discretized!).

The race parameters (as well as \code{response}, \code{th1},
and \code{th2}) are recycled to the length of the result (either \code{rt} or \code{n}).
In other words, the functions are completely vectorized for all parameters
and even the response.

\description{
Probability densities and random number generators for response times,
decisions and confidence judgments in the independent Race Model
(\code{dIRM}/\code{rIRM}) or partially (anti-)correlated Race Model (\code{dPCRM}/\code{rPCRM}),
i.e. the probability of a given response (response: winning accumulator
(1 or 2)) at a given time (rt) and the confidence measure in the interval
between th1 and th2 (Hellmann et al., preprint). The definition of the
confidence measure depends on the argument \code{time_scaled} (see Details).
The computations are based on Moreno-Bote (2010).
The parameters for the models are \code{mu1} and \code{mu2} for the drift
rates, \code{a}, \code{b} for the upper thresholds of the two accumulators
and \code{s} for the incremental standard deviation of the processes and
\code{t0} and \code{st0} for the  minimum and range of uniformly distributed
non-decision times (including encoding and motor time).
For the computation of confidence judgments, the parameters \code{th1} and
\code{th2} for the lower and upper bound of the interval for confidence
measure and if \code{time_scaled} is \code{TRUE} the weight parameters \code{wx}, \code{wrt},
\code{wint} for the computation of the confidence measure are required (see Details).
}
\details{
The parameters are formulated, s.t. both accumulators start at 0 and trigger a decision at their
positive boundary \code{a} and \code{b} respectively. That means, both parameters have to be positive.
Internally the computations adapt the parametrization of Moreno-Bote (2010).

\code{time_scaled} determines whether the confidence measure is computed in accordance to the
Balance of Evidence hypothesis (if \code{time_scaled=FALSE}), i.e. if \code{response} is 1 at time T and
\eqn{X_2}{X2} is the second accumulator, then
\deqn{conf = b - X_2(T)}{conf = b - X2(T)}.
Otherwise, if \code{time_scaled=TRUE} (default), confidence is computed as linear combination of
Balance of Evidence, decision time, and an interaction term, i.e.
\deqn{conf = wx (b-X_2 (T)) + wrt\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}} + wint\frac{b-X_2(T)}{\sqrt{T}}.}{conf = wx (b-X2(T)) + wrt/\sqrt{T} + wint (b-X2(T))\sqrt{T}.}
Usually the weights (\code{wx}, \code{wrt}, \code{wint}) should sum to 1, as the confidence thresholds
(\code{th1} and \code{th2}) may be scaled according to their sum. If this is not the case, they will be scaled
accordingly internally! Usually, this formula results in lower confidence when the reaction time is
longer but the state of the second accumulator is held constant. It is based on the optimal decision
confidence in Moreno-Bote (2010).

For convenience, the likelihood function allows that the first argument is a \code{data.frame} containing the
information of the first and second argument in the columns
(i.e., \code{rt} and \code{response}). Other columns (as well as passing
\code{response} separately as argument) will be ignored.

The simulations are done by simulating normal variables in discretized steps until
one process reaches the boundary. If no boundary is met within the maximum time, response is
set to 0.
}
\note{
Similarly to the drift diffusion models (like \code{ddiffusion} and
\code{\link{dWEV}}), \code{s1} and \code{s2} are scaling factors (\code{s1} scales: \code{mu1} and  \code{a},
\code{s2} scales: \code{mu2} and \code{b}, and depending on response: if \code{response=2}, \code{s1} scales
\code{th1},\code{th2},and \code{wrt}), otherwise \code{s2} is the scaling factor. It is sometimes
assumed (Moreno-Bote, 2010), that both noise terms are equal, then they should definitely be
fixed for fitting.

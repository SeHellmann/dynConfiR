\title{Log-Likelihood functions for the independent and partially anti-correlated race models of confidence}
\usage{
LogLikRM(data, paramDf, model = "IRM", time_scaled = FALSE,
  data_names = list(), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a dataframe where each row is one trial. Containing following variables:
\itemize{
  \item condition    (not necessary; convertable to integer (e.g. factor); for different levels of stimulus quality),
  \item rating            (convertable to integer (e.g. factor); discrete confidence judgments),
  \item rt                    (numeric; giving reaction times for decision task),
  \item stimulus     (values at least convertible to c(1,2); stimulus category (index of accumulator with positive drift))
  \item response     (values at least convertible to c(1,2); direction of decision; (index of accumulator reaching the boundary first))

}}

\item{paramDf}{list or dataframe with one row. Names should match the names of IRM and PCRM model specific parameter names.
For different stimulus quality/mean drift rates, names should be v1, v2, v3,.... Different s parameters are possible with s1, s2, s3...
with equally many steps as for drift rates. Additionally, the confidence thresholds should be given by names with
thetaUpper1, thetaUpper2,..., thetaLower1,... or, for symmetric thresholds only by theta1, theta2,.... (see Details for the correspondance to the data)}

\item{model}{character scalar. One of "IRM" or "PCRM". ("IRMt" and "PCRMt" will also be accepted. In that case,
time_scaled is set to TRUE.)}

\item{time_scaled}{logical. Whether the confidence measure should be scaled by 1/sqrt(rt). Default: TRUE.}

\item{data_names}{list. Possibility of giving alternative column names for the variables in the data. By default columnnames are identical to the
ones given in the data argument description.}

\item{...}{Possibility of giving alternative variable names (unquoted) in data frame (in the form \code{condition = SOA}).}
}
\value{
Numeric scalar. The summed Log-likelihood of the data given the parameters in the respective model. If one or more row-wise probabilities is <=0,
the function returns -1e+12.
}
\description{
Computes the Log-likelihood for given data and parameters in the IRM and PCRM with or without time-scaled
confidence measure. It is a wrapped version of the respective densities \code{\link{dIRM}} and \code{\link{dPCRM}}, where one can
find more information about the parameters. The function is mainly used inside \code{\link{fitRTConf}} for race models but exported
for individual usage in other contexts.
}
\details{
Note, that the requirements on the format of the columns for the likelihood functions are much stricter, than in \code{\link{fitRTConf}}.
This is because the function is very frequently calls in the optimisation routines of the fitting process and the preprocessing steps are
therefore included in that function.

 \strong{rating, condition}. If integer, values should range from 1 to number of possible ratings/conditions. If factor, the number of levels should be
 equal to number of possible ratings/conditions. This should be consistent with the parameter vector. The confidence thresholds should be named
 as thetaUpper1, thetaLower1,.... (or theta1,... for symmetric thresholds), with the number of ratings -1 and the mean drift rates (and possibly the
 standard deviation in drift rates) should be denoted as v1, v2,... (and sv1, sv2,...) with the number equal to the number of conditions. If only
 one condition is used \code{v} will be accepted as well as \code{v1}.

 \strong{stimulus, response}. stimulus and response should always be given in numerical format with values 1 and 2.
 Stimulus determines which of two accumulators has positive drift. The other has negative drift with the same absolute
 value. Response gives the index of the accumulator that reaches the boundary first.

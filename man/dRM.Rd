\description{
Probability densities for response times, decisions and confidence judgments
in the independent Race Model (dIRM) or partially (anti-)correlated Race Model (dPCRM),
i.e. the probability of a given response (response: winning accumulator (1 or 2)) at a
given time (rts) and the confidence measure in interval between th1 and th2. The definition
of the confidence measure depends on the argument \code{time_scaled} (see Details).
The computations are based on Moreno-Bote (2010).
}
\details{
The parameters for the models are \code{mu1} and \code{mu2} for the drift rates, \code{a}, \code{b}
for the starting points of the two accumulators and \code{s}/\code{sigma} for the incremental standard deviation
of the processes and \code{t0} and \code{st0} for the  minimum and range of uniformly distributed
non-decision times (including encoding and motor time).
For dIRM and dPCRM additionally the parameters \code{th1} and \code{th2} for
the lower and upper bound of the interval for the loosing accumulator.

\code{time_scaled} determines whether the confidence measure is computed in accordance to the
Balance of Evidence hypothesis, i.e. if response is 1 at time T, then \eqn{conf = b - X_2(T)}.
Otherwise, if \code{time_scaled=TRUE} (default), confidence is computed as linear combination of
Balance of Evidence and decision time, i.e.
\eqn{conf = wx (b-X_2 (T)) + wrt\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}} + wint\frac{b-X_2(T)}{\sqrt{T}}}.
Usually the weights (wx, wrt, wint) should sum to 1, as the confidence thresholds (th1 and th2) may be scaled
according to their sum. If this is not the case, they will be scaled accordingly internally! Usually, this
formula results in lower confidence when the reaction time is longer but the state of the second accumulator
is held constant. It is based on the optimal decision confidence in Moreno-Bote (2010).

For convenience, the function allows that the first argument is a \code{data.frame} containing the
information of the first and second argument in the columns
(i.e., \code{rt} and \code{response}). Other columns (as well as passing
\code{response} separately as argument) will be ignored.
}
\note{
Similarly to the drift diffusion models (like \code{\link[rtdists:Diffusion]{ddiffusion}} and
\code{\link{dWEV}}), s is a scaling factor (scales: \code{mu1},\code{mu2}, \code{a},\code{b},
\code{th1},\code{th2},and \code{wrt}) and is usually fixed to 1.

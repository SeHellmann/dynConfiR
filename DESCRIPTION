Description: Provides density functions for the joint distribution of
    choice, response time and confidence for discrete confidence judgments
    as well as functions for parameter fitting, prediction and simulation
    for various dynamical models of decision confidence.  All models are
    explained in detail by Hellmann et al.  (preprint;
    <https://osf.io/9jfqr/>).  Implemented models are the dynWEV model,
    the 2DSD model (Pleskac & Busemeyer, 2010, <doi:10.1037/a0019737>),
    and various race models.  C++ code for dynWEV and 2DSD is based on the
    'rtdists' package by Henrik Singmann.
